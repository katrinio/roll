## `roll`

A small CLI for managing a film photography archive.

`roll` follows a roll of film from the moment it is loaded into a camera until it becomes part of the archive.

---

## Why

I don't shoot film often enough to remember everything months later.

`roll` helps answer questions like:

- Which films do I still have?
- What's currently loaded?
- Where is that roll I took with Kir?
- Which camera, film and lab was it?

The goal is to keep this information next to the archive instead of in my head.

---

## Principles

`roll` doesn't try to replace your photo archive.

Your archive stays an ordinary folder. `roll` only keeps the information that would be difficult to reconstruct later.

Some principles behind the project:

- the archive belongs to the user;
- data lives inside the archive;
- everything is stored as plain text;
- removing the application never removes your data;
- the user only enters what cannot be detected automatically.

## Storage

```text
<archive>
├── .roll
│   ├── stock.toml
│   └── vocabulary/
│       ├── films.txt
│       ├── cameras.txt
│       ├── features.txt
│       └── keywords.txt
└── 2026/
    └── 05-12-e02775/
        └── roll.toml
```

- `stock.toml` — film stock
- `vocabulary/` — autocomplete dictionaries
- `roll.toml` — metadata for a single roll

Everything lives inside the archive. The application can be removed or reinstalled without affecting your data.
